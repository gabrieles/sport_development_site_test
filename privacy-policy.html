				<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
				<p>Great to see you here! Most people ignore privacy policies, so you are already doing a great job in taking the time read this.</p>
				<p>To keep this as short and simple as possible: we collect only the information that we need to run this site, and we never share it with third parties (but we are using services on Google, so they can see our data.)</p>
				<p>Specifically, for all site visitors, please be aware that we use Google Analytics to have analytics on how people use this site. We are not looking for personal details but only for aggregated data to better understand how to improve this system (for example, how many users have visited the site this month, how many visits each page has received, etc.)</p>
				<p>On the other hand, if you are submitting a form (we have three: "Ask", "Give", and "Contact") we will ask you to login into G Suite by Google, as all forms are in there. This allows us to track who submitted the form, and get back in touch with you. Different forms will ask you to fill different details, and will tell why we are collecting that data directly on the form. We may use your email to get in touch if we ever update this privacy policy, too, or for other similarly important communications. We do no try to track any more information than what you are giving us in the form, and you can get in touch to ask us to delete this information at any time. Lastly, we will never share your data with third parties.</p> 
				<p>This is it.</p>
