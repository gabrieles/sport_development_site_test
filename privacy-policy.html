				<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
				<p>Great to see you here! Thank you for taking the time read this - it is important.</p>
				<p>In short: we collect only the information that we need to run this site, we keep it secure, and we never share it with third parties.</p>
				<p>Specifically, we use <a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> to understand usage patterns on this site. We are not looking for personal details but only for aggregated data (for example, how many users have visited the site this month, how many visits each page has received, etc.) We need this data to monitor and improve the system.</p>
				<p>When you submit a form we ask you to login into <a href="https://gsuite.google.com">G Suite</a> by Google, as all forms are in there. This allows us to track who submitted the form, and get back in touch with you, as we always collect the email. On top of that some forms may ask you for more details. In this case there will be a short description of why need it.<p>
                <p>We may also use your data to get in touch if we ever update this privacy policy, too, or for other similarly important communications, but we will never share your data with third parties. You can get in touch to ask us to delete you information at any time, too.</p> 
				<p>Last but not least, your data is stored in G Suite, which was selected as it is <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance">compliant with several data protection laws</a> (including the GDPR) and <a href="https://gsuite.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/security">secure</a>, but if something happens on their system we cannot be liable for it, as they are entirely managed by Google (which are far more capable than the people running this site...)</p>
                <p>This is it.</p>
